101,Montana will sign contracts only with internet service providers that honor “ net neutrality ” firms    [TGT]said on Monday   the latest effort by a state to undermine a Federal Communications Commission order rolling back rules introduced in 2015 .  [TGT]signed an executive order requiring state contract recipients to adhere to so - called net neutrality   which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes   also known as paid prioritization . The Republican - majority FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse the 2015 rules . The new rules will not take effect for at least three months   the FCC has said . A spokeswoman for the FCC declined to comment on the decision by [TGT] Democrat . “ There has been a lot of talk around the country about how to respond to the recent decision by Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality rules   which keep the internet free and open . It ’ s time to actually do something about it  ” [TGT] said in a statement . “ This is a simple step states can take to preserve and protect net neutrality . We can ’ t wait for folks in Washington DC to come to their senses and reinstate these rules .” Other states are considering similar efforts . The FCC order in December said it would block state and local rules that “ could impose far greater burdens than the federal regulatory regime .” Last week   a group of 21 U . S . state attorneys general and the District of Columbia   filed legal papers to challenge the FCC ’ s decision to do away with net neutrality while Democrats said they needed just one more vote in the Senate to repeal the FCC ruling . Republicans control both chambers of Congress   so even if Democrats could win a Senate majority   a repeal would also require winning a vote in the House of Representatives and would then still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump . Trump   a Republican   backed the FCC action and overturning a presidential veto requires a two - thirds vote in both chambers . The FCC vote handed AT & T Inc   Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc power over what content consumers can access on the internet . Companies including Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc said they would support a legal challenge through an industry group .,408,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

Then fighting for the starting job he eventually won back , [TGT] made it clear [TGT] was also fighting for social justice and against police brutality against African Americans . 
The following week , [TGT] decided to kneel rather than sit during the anthem .

She ’s a savvy businesswoman who understands the shifting tides of  her  audience and the pop marketplace more clearly than most music industry executives. And so  her  albums are as much perfectly executed marketing plans as they are musical statements.

Little wonder  her  music rarely sounds so unruffled  so sure of itself.  Her  earliest albums boasted a callow  openhearted charm   her  transparency about the awkwardness of teenager-hood striking a chord with  her  young fans. But in adulthood  calculation and cash have usurped raw diary entries as guiding principles. Now when  she ’s picking at the carcass of an ex-lover or taking shots at Kanye or Kim  it feeds the churn in the gossipy corners of social media more than upsetting musical convention.
But the  Swift  who used to treat  her  fans like confidantes instead of a marketing demographic resurfaces only as the album winds down.

But [TGT] said the regime had ""more seriously cruel policies than those of (the) Gang of Four of China"" since it enslaved the population on collective farms and began to carry out mass killings immediately after seizing power.
""The policy of (the Khmer Rouge) was criminal [TGT] said. ""The killing was widespread.""
[TGT] added that only the ""collective peasant class and collective worker class"" remained throughout the country after the educated and elites were murdered.
[TGT] apologised at [TGT] trial late March  saying [TGT] accepted blame for the extermination of thousands of people at the prison  which served as the centre of the 1975-1979 regime's security apparatus.
On [TGT] told the trial that [TGT] staff had murdered babies by smashing them against trees at a ""killing field"".
But [TGT] has denied prosecutors' claims that [TGT] played a central role in the Khmer Rouge's iron-fisted rule  and maintains [TGT] only tortured two people himself and never personally executed anyone.

Ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings  D-Maryland  wrote to chairman Rep.

According to the whistleblower   Flynn  also informed the associate that  his  business partners would be able to move forward with their project  which aimed to construct a network of nuclear reactors across the Mideast with support from Russian and other international interests.

If you can put something together and prove to me that there’s a book here then I’ll think about it. And he put something together… [I] sent it to my agent and it sold in a day.”
When asked if going through her mother’s belongings helped her cope with the loss   Melissa  joked  “I’m not sure the book helped me cope  but it certainly helped get my storage bills under control.”
While  Melissa  wasn’t surprised by the discovery  as it was far from a family secret  fans will be shocked to learn that Joan  who was recognized as one of America’s most successful female stand-up comics  originally dreamed of a different role for herself.
“…The message that came back to my mom was ‘It doesn’t hurt me where I live ’” said  Melissa . “Which is a pretty incredible answer. And as we saw the things that  she  did later in life  you get that.  She  always knew who  she  was  regardless of everything that was swirling around  her .""
And while some of Joan’s infamous jokes could have easily offended  her  targets   Melissa  insisted  she  was never out to hurt anyone. And if Joan was aware that any of  her  subjects or their families were genuinely upset by  her  puns   she  would immediately remove them from  her  act.
“You look at the bulk of the material  and I would say a good 98 percent is self-deprecating with  her  as the butt of the joke ” said  Melissa . “Everyone used to ask if it would upset my dad (TV producer Edgar Rosenberg) that  she  made so many jokes about my dad. And my mom would always say  ‘You aren’t listening carefully. The jokes aren’t about Edgar. The jokes are about me!’… It was making fun of herself… She was never intent on hurting anyone.”
But Joan easily gained both fame and famous fans  including former President Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles.  Melissa  explained humor was the reason behind their lasting friendships.
“President Reagan was funny ” said  Melissa . “You forget  he was an actor and a great storyteller… And my mother’s dear friend was Nancy Reagan. So that was a friendship that lasted through the years.",415,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

“You look at the bulk of the material  and I would say a good 98 percent is self-deprecating with  her  as the butt of the joke ” said  Melissa . “Everyone used to ask if it would upset my dad (TV producer Edgar Rosenberg) that  she  made so many jokes about my dad. And my mom would always say  ‘You aren’t listening carefully. The jokes aren’t about Edgar. The jokes are about me!’… It was making fun of herself… She was never intent on hurting anyone.”
But Joan easily gained both fame and famous fans  including former President Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles.  Melissa  explained humor was the reason behind their lasting friendships.

In conversation with NPR's Kelly McEvers  two writers — Caitlin Flanagan of The Atlantic and Anna North of Vox — discuss whether the story describes a bad date  sexual assault or something in between.
People are talking a lot about what happened after a dinner date between the comedian Aziz Ansari and a young woman going by the name of Grace. That's not her real name. The website Babe published her account of that date and said it protected her identity because she's not a public figure. Grace says she decided to tell her story after she saw  [TGT]win an award at last week's Golden Globes.  [TGT]  was wearing a pin to support the movement against sexual harassment and assault.
MCEVERS: We should just say  [TGT]acknowledged in a statement that this date did happen.  [TGT]  said  quote  ""we ended up engaging in sexual activity  which by all indications was completely consensual.""

498,"Three and a half months after he was nearly killed in a shooting  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) made a triumphant return to the House floor on Thursday.
While today is obviously an emotional day for everyone in Congress  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) was especially excited to have his friend back at work. A series of photos show Ryan tearing up when he first saw  Scalise .

Modi  and  his  Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party  are fighting to retain control of the local assembly in Gujarat  the western Indian state that was ruled by Modi for more than a decade before he became India's leader.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) stands near  Rahul Gandhi (L)  during the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament Attack at Parliament House on December 13  2017  in New Delhi.
Born in 1970   Gandhi  is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  His  grandmother Indira was India's first female leader  and  his  grandfather  Jawarhlal Nehru  was the country's founding Prime Minister. Both Indira and Rajiv were assassinated while in office.
But he has been slow to take the top job  even though he was the face of the Congress Party's campaign during the 2014 national elections. The results were a blow to the party  which suffered its worst ever electoral loss  ceding power in Delhi to Modi  who promised to usher in an era of economic revival. The BJP campaign also targeted  Gandhi   portraying  him  as entitled and out of touch. It worked. The Congress Party won just 44 Parliamentary seats to the BJP's 282.

516,"The defense evaluation quotes  Christian  as saying the two girls were 15 feet away and  he  didn't speak to them or direct  his  comments at them.
""At odds with accounts in the media   Mr. Christian  reported that the two girls on the MAX did not cross  his  mind "" wrote Dr. Mark D. Cunningham  a Seattle-based psychologist.
Cunningham said  Christian  liked to make inflammatory comments in public to assert his right to free speech but was not driven by racial hatred. He had consumed sangria that day and planned to ""do his free speech thing"" because he was angry about being pepper-sprayed the night before by a passenger on another train.
"" Mr. Christian  reported that if  he  has been drinking   he  tends to 'talk politics' on the MAX to see if  he  'can get someone's goat '"" Cunningham wrote.
According to the detective's previous testimony  Christian got on the train about 12 minutes before the attack  initially talking on  his  cellphone before making statements toward passengers in an agitated manner. Michaels said many witnesses heard xenophobic comments and rants about free speech.

568,"Estimates of the size of a  Hurricane Harvey  aid package for Texas and Louisiana rose on Thursday  with one proposal being drafted for $150 billion  while the White House promised to make a request for funding soon to Congress.
The Trump administration will make a request to the U.S. Congress shortly for funds to help recovery efforts from  [TGT] devastating flooding   White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said.
U.S. taxpayers are likely to face a bill for  Harvey  near the $110.2 billion for 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Estimates on the amount of the  [TGT]aid varied widely.
A Republican leadership source said Congress was expected to consider and vote on an initial allocation of  [TGT]aid in the first half of September.
The urgency of aiding areas hit by  [TGT]may also complicate a broader fiscal policy showdown that is coming in late September.
When  [TGT]plowed into the Texas coast this week  Congress and President Donald Trump were already struggling to deal with the debt ceiling  which is a cap on how much money the federal government can borrow  and the need to approve a temporary federal budget bill by Oct. 1 to prevent a government shutdown.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told broadcaster CNBC on Thursday that the impact of [TGT] spending could bring forward the deadline by which the nation's debt ceiling needs to be raised by ""a couple of days."" He repeated that the limit needs to be raised by Sept. 29

588,"""After Ariel’s first year of school attending City College  being a fellow Republican  he told me the struggles he was having on a daily basis with his peers and even teachers for being a member of the Republican party. This broke my heart to hear  as I knew how passionate  Ariel  was about Republican beliefs that represent way more than a single name on a ticket.
"" Ariel  rolled up  his  sleeves and joined as many Republican campaigns as  he  could  including the mayor of New York City. Not only did  he  take part in several campaigns   he  is now telling the world that  he  will do what  he  believes in no matter what people say around  him   by starting a campaign of  his  own and running for New York State Assembly.  Ariel  is truly a remarkable young man and continues to amaze me every day.
""As one of  his  mentor’s I can say with no shame  there has been more than one occasion that  Ariel  has showed me courage that I may not have had. I have no doubt that  he  will serve  his  community to  his  fullest capabilities with major success. And I wish  him  nothing but the best of luck and support a long the way.""

Rosen is the most Day 1 ready in the eyes of most evaluators.  Darnold  has intangibles that makes NFL teams salivate. Allen has the best physical traits of the three.

He  creates and just makes plays happen.  He  just has that ‘it’ factor more than the other two.

INDIANAPOLIS –  [TGT] ’s return to coaching after nearly a decade in broadcasting hasn’t been entirely easy  [TGT] said Wednesday at the NFL scouting combine.
The challenge hasn’t been building his coaching staff or the process of creating his offensive playbook. Instead   Gruden 's biggest issue has been the fact that nearly two months after he was introduced as the Raiders coach  he hasn’t been able to meet with his players.
NFL rules prohibit contact between coaches and players during the offseason  which stretches from early January (for non-playoff teams) until April 9.  [TGT]has seen some players in the Raiders’ facility in Alameda  Calif.  but rules bar them from talking about football.
“I always complained about that since the new (collective bargaining agreement) came into place. A lot of players would come to see me in Tampa to get their football fix ”  [TGT]said  “So you're not allowed to have contact with these guys  and what's most discouraging to [TGT] is we've got to make some decisions on our roster  on salaries  on players and their futures and you can't even meet them. I don't know these guys. I've never coached them  I've never met half of them. So that's been very  very difficult for me  and I've been emotional about it at times.”",233,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

Veterinarians at the National Zoo in Washington  D.C.  say  [TGT]an adult male panda   received laser treatment and acupuncture for what [TGT] initially thought was a touch of arthritis in  [TGT]  left shoulder.
During the exam earlier this week while  the 20-year-old Tian Tian  (pronounced t-YEN t-YEN) was under anesthesia  vets also took blood and urine samples and performed X-rays.
""Veterinarians did not find anything abnormal  but  [TGT]may be starting to show some changes that are normal for an older bear "" according to the zoo's website. ""The biggest change that the keepers have noticed is that he has lost some weight during the past several months. He weighs 260 pounds  and his weight has been holding steady for the past month. His behavior and appetite are normal  but the panda team wanted to take a closer look as an extra precaution.""
Veterinarians said they also took the opportunity while  [TGT]was under ""to perform acupuncture and laser treatment — both are complementary treatments. The acupuncture may help improve some of  Tian Tian 's overall muscle tone  and the laser treatment may help suspected arthritis in  his  left shoulder.""

794,"White House chief of staff John Kelly has come under fire for his defense of [TGT]  who resigned as White House staff secretary Wednesday after his two ex-wives publicly accused him of domestic abuse.
In the wake of  White House staff secretary [TGT] 's resignation on Wednesday amid multiple accusations of domestic abuse  White House chief of staff John Kelly has found  himself  ensnared in the mounting scandal.
A growing chorus of West Wing staffers and Republicans have begun to question why  he  came out to bat for  Porter  — and whether Kelly had known about the allegations against  him .
At first  Kelly defended  Porter  after  his  second ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby accused  him  of emotional and physical abuse.
Kelly called  Porter  ""a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about  him .  He  is a friend  a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside  him .""
On Wednesday  Porter's first ex-wife Colbie Holderness came out with accusations of her own against  Porter  that included domestic battery and verbal abuse on their honeymoon. She backed up her claims with a photo of a black eye she said  Porter  gave her.
Kelly  who had worked closely with  Porter  for several months  then issued a statement speaking out against domestic abuse in general without specifically condemning  Porter  himself.
""I was shocked by the new allegations released today against  [TGT]  "" Kelly said. ""There is no place for domestic violence in our society.""
""I think it's fair to say that we all could have done better over the last few days in dealing with the situation "" he said  ""but this was a [TGT] that many of us dealt with  and the emerging reports were not reflective of the individual we had come to know.""
Despite Shah's insistence the Trump ""maintains full confidence"" in Kelly  a report by Vanity Fair indicates that Trump had become furious with members of his staff after the severity of the  Porter  allegations became clear.
Kelly isn't the only one in hot water  according to the report — his advisers Ivanka Trump  Jared Kushner  and communications director Hope Hicks  who is reportedly dating  Porter   have also drawn the president's ire.

A growing chorus of Republicans  including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  have called on   [TGT] to withdraw from a special election in Alabama if allegations prove true that the former judge initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl nearly four decades ago.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders  who was accompanying Trump as he traveled from China to Vietnam on Friday  said  âLike most Americans  the president does not believe we can allow a mere allegation  in this case one from many years ago  to destroy a personâs life. However  the president also believes that if these allegations are true    [TGT] will do the right thing and step aside.â
Other Republican senators weighing in included Jeff Flake of Arizona  David Perdue of Georgia  John Thune of South Dakota  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  Cory Gardner of Colorado  Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called on  Moore  to step aside as well â and without couching his statement with âif trueâ language.
âThe allegations against  [TGT] are deeply disturbing and disqualifying â McCain said. âHe should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.â

Alabama is a Republican stronghold that hasn't been represented by a Democratic senator since 1996  and it's a state where President Trump is still reliably popular.
However  the election was rocked last week by a Washington Post story  in which four women who alleged that   [TGT] dated or tried to date them when they were teens and   [TGT]   was in   [TGT]   early 30s. The most serious allegations come from Leigh Corfmann  who said that   [TGT] undressed and touched  her  when  she  was 14 and   [TGT]   was 32 in 1979.
It's impossible to know whether the allegations  which are disputed by  Moore   will cost  him  the Senate race. But what we do know is that they are disturbing and hard to debunk.
So  he  could still win?
Yes  it's easy to imagine a scenario in which   [TGT] wins despite the allegations. But it's also possible that Democrat Doug Jones  a former U.S. Attorney who made his name prosecuting Klansmen and domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph  could pull out a win.
Some experts on Alabama politics insist that   [TGT] is still the favorite and will likely be elected  albeit narrowly. Conservative writer Quin Hillyer  who has been critical of  Moore  and Mr. Trump and once ran for Congress in the state  tweeted after the story broke on Thursday that   [TGT] was still on track to win.

It's a shocking strategy that speaks to Bannon's fears that he could be blamed for  Moore 's loss. Bannon was a supporter of   [TGT] during the GOP primary and rushed to take credit for his win. He did this despite the fact that   [TGT] won largely for reasons that have nothing to do with Bannon  such as Sen.

864," [TGT] also has a long history of controversial statements  such as   [TGT]   contention that the 9/11 attacks may have been a divine punishment for America's sins. But while  [TGT]  [TGT]   penchant for inflammatory remarks embarrasses many Alabama Republicans  it's also helped   [TGT]   develop a hardcore following that allowed   [TGT]   to easily triumph over Sen. Luther Strange   the Trump-backed Republican incumbent  [TGT] knocked off in the September primary.
In a sense  Democrats have lucked out in having Jones on the ballot. He's known as a sober  competent public servant  and with   [TGT] struggling in the wake of a sex scandal   [TGT]  has a very real shot of winning the seat.
But Jones is also quite liberal by Alabama standards  particularly on social issues like abortion. He also has the burden of campaigning as a Democrat in a state where the Democratic Party is deeply unpopular. Before   [TGT]  's sex scandal  Jones looked like someone who could outperform a typical Democrat running in the state  but did not appear to be quite within striking distance of  [TGT]  .
Plenty of Republicans who dislike   [TGT] might vote for   [TGT]   anyway if only to stop Sen. Chuck Schumer's Democrats from having another vote in the Senate. Although given the most recent revelations about  [TGT] it's also possible that many of these Republicans stay home  which could give Jones the edge if Democrats turn out in droves  which they probably will.
One thing to watch for is how the defenses of   [TGT] play out on the ground.

865,"Over the weekend  internet users began to focus on a company called Strava that published a âheat mapâ showing its users around the world.  [TGT]  bills itself as a âsocial-networking app for athletes.â The âheat mapâ showed the location of all the rides  runs  swims  and downhills that its users have taken  as collected by their smartphones and wearables.
Because as bad as the publicly available heat map is  the underlying data that  [TGT]  is collecting is a security nightmare for governments around the world. The data being collected could allow anyone with access to it the ability to make a pattern of life map for individual users  some of whom may be very interesting.
Taiwan did not move the base  though. And  as you can see  there are a number of avid Strava users who work there  causally jogging right by the parking lot where the missile launchers are parked.
Now here is the problem. This is only one of several missile bases in Taiwanâan important one  to be sure  but there are others  and some of those locations may still be secret. (At the Middlebury Institute of International studies at Monterey  we try to track these bases pretty closely. Weâre confident we know where several are located  for example  but not all of them.) But  Stravaâs  database has one more piece of information  one that is not accessible through the heat map but would be to the company  any client which might purchase the data and any hacker that might steal  it .   [TGT] knows which user made each track. Thatâs charming when   [TGT]  âs a celebrity uploading a run. But what about a soldier? Soldiers  remember  rotate from one assignment to the next. Which means   [TGT] can continue to track each user as   [TGT]   or  she  rotates to the next assignment  burning one secret missile base after another with all those calories. Yes  if our user casually jogging by Taiwanese missiles day-after-day suddenly appears deployed to a new location  well thatâs very interesting if you are targeting missiles for Chinaâs Rocket Force.
A fair amount of personal data appears to be shared willingly by users  more than enough to make me uncomfortable. A bigger concern  of course  is whether hackers might be able to breach security and get at the data marked private. If I were a   [TGT] employee  Iâd be very careful about what sort of email links I clicked on.
None of this is to blame   [TGT]  [TGT]   provides a service that lots of people obviously find useful. I myself could use to lose a few pounds. And  of course  it isnât like Taiwanâs efforts at secrecy were super impressive to begin with.

874,"Carter 's costumes needed to evoke an African country that had never been colonized  one that looked toward the future but was based on a real past. So she found inspiration from African art and craft  and indigenous tribal wear from all over the continent. Then she and her team worked to create group drawings of the various groups in Wakanda.
""And we did them as they were centuries ago "" she says. ""Then  it was a process of deciding how we go from there in the past  to where Wakanda would be in the future.""

Shuri wears a traditional costume  including a corset inspired by the Dinka people  and she shouts at one point  ""Can we get a move on? This corset is uncomfortable.
""So she told us right away that that's not where she comes from  that's not where she wants to be mentally ""  Carter  says. From there on out  Shuri dresses in clothes with modern sillhouettes and fabrics â  Carter  chose youthful  vibrant colors overlaid with mesh fabrics or bold outlines. But  Carter  says the shape of  her  clothing still holds meaning.

One of the central charges is that   [TGT] pressured executive branch officials to try and resolve an $8.9 million Medicare reimbursement dispute Melgen was embroiled in.
In Sunday's filing  attorneys wrote that they should have been allowed to introduce information  including a document from the official Medicare website  that would have buttressed their contention that   [TGT]  's meetings with health officials were focused on confusing and inconsistent Medicare reimbursement policies  and not on Melgen's specific case as the indictment alleges.
They also contend Walls should have allowed testimony from Marc Elias  an attorney who represented  [TGT]  in late 2012 and early 2013 when   [TGT] was being investigated by a Senate ethics committee over the flights on Melgen's plane.
Elias  who was scheduled to testify Thursday but didn't  would have told jurors he sent a letter to ethics investigators saying the flights were being reviewed â a point defense attorneys say could cast doubt on the prosecution's theory that   [TGT] was trying to conceal   [TGT]   involvement with Melgen.

Doocy was eager to help cast  Arpaio  as an acolyte of Trump  who receives almost nothing but fawning coverage on Fox & Friends  a show  [TGT]  regularly live-tweets. After asking   [TGT]   what part of  his  experience as sheriff âwould be most helpful in the U.S. Senate â Doocy followed up by inquiring if  he  wants to âdrain the swampâ like Trump.
âOh  I would have a lot of fun â  Arpaio  replied.
Doocy ended the segment by mistakenly calling  Arpaio  âSenator Joe Arpaioâ and wishing  him  good luck.

909,"According to  [TGT] was once the measure of potential devastation. ""We learned from Katrina that's not the case ""  [TGT]  said. What people should worry about is rainfall and storm surge (water blown in by hurricane winds)  which may seem intertwined if you've never been on the ground during a hurricane  but are actually two distinct phenomena.
""In the months after Katrina "" said   [TGT] ""the big issue was that there was still water in many places that they were pumping out as fast as they could  and then they'd get another storm  or a hurricane would come in and dump more water.""
More bad news: ""The residents have to recognize that they have a residual risk from the levee they have right now  if you have a Katrina-like event  or something bigger ""  [TGT]  told me.

1039," [TGT] drivers can drive for other companies  or get other jobs (that's key to  Uber 's claim that  its  drivers aren't employees  without which  [TGT]  would be unambiguously doomed);  [TGT]  rival Lyft is happy to go on paying drivers more (for now)  and drivers have already shown that it's pretty easy to ditch the platform  create their own app  and pocket 25% more than  [TGT]  will pay them.
So   [TGT]  's already losing drivers  and also they lost $4.6 billion -- and to become profitable  they'll have to find another $4.6 billion in cost-cutting  which is unlikely to come from drivers  whom they're actually going to have to start paying more if they want to continue to have cars on the street.
For  Uber  to find an additional $4.6b/year in savings  there would have to be some indication that their costs were actually going down with scale. They're not. Insurance  a major cost to   [TGT] is rising linearly with revenue. Other costs have gone down thanks to deep cuts: Operations  Sales and Marketing  Research and Development  and General and Administration. Unless the company starts spending more on these  they will not continue to grow  and thus will continue to lose billions.
What's more    [TGT]  's figures are totally untrustworthy. Every financial report from   [TGT] picks a different set of accounting practices  selected to cast  [TGT]  dismal finances in the best possible light (and even with that cherry-picking    [TGT] is still losing $4.5B/year!). So things are likely much  much worse.
All previous releases of   [TGT] revenue data were limited to the top-line âGross passenger paymentsâ (the total money paid by passengers) and â Uber  revenueâ  the 20-30% of that total retained by  Uber . In past analysis  I had assumed that the difference went almost entirely to drivers  but the newly released data shows this assumption is not true  and that   [TGT] may be inflating the top-line revenue number. In 2017  roughly $3 billion[8] of this revenue was âRefunds  Taxes and Feesâ or âRider Promotions.â Government charges and fares that are refunded should not have been included in the original gross revenue number. The âRider Promotionsâ item is more problematic.

1049,"Musk  believes if the Falcon Heavy can successfully get  its  very cool payload into space   it  will no longer make sense to use other vehicles certified for heavy lift launches  like the Delta IV Heavy  Russia's Proton  or Europe's Ariane 5. That's because of the same reason SpaceX's other rockets are already revolutionizing the business of getting to space â it's a lot cheaper to re-use the rocket boosters that propel something out of Earth's gravity well than to use new ones every time.
The Falcon Heavy isn't the only high-powered rocket SpaceX has in the works â the company is also working on the system known as the BFR  which it plans to certify for crewed missions.  Musk  said  it  is designed to be re-used more quickly than the Falcon Heavy.
If SpaceX wanted to make Falcon Heavy even more powerful   Musk  said  the company  could bring up the power pretty close to the Saturn V  the most powerful rocket in history. That's because Falcon Heavy essentially takes the Falcon 9 system  which SpaceX has now launched and landed quite a few times  and adds two identical first stage boosters (which provide most of the rocket's thrust) to the sides of the central booster  cranking up the power.
""We could dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want  we could add two more side boosters  make it Falcon Super Heavy  get upwards of 9 million pounds of thrust ""  Musk  said on the press call.
For now   it  appears unnecessary for SpaceX to make a rocket that powerful.  It  would need extra testing and provide more power than what planned future Falcon Heavy missions would require.",281,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

The Falcon Heavy isn't the only high-powered rocket SpaceX has in the works â the company is also working on the system known as the BFR  which it plans to certify for crewed missions.  Musk  said  it  is designed to be re-used more quickly than the Falcon Heavy.
If SpaceX wanted to make Falcon Heavy even more powerful   Musk  said  the company  could bring up the power pretty close to the Saturn V  the most powerful rocket in history. That's because Falcon Heavy essentially takes the Falcon 9 system  which SpaceX has now launched and landed quite a few times  and adds two identical first stage boosters (which provide most of the rocket's thrust) to the sides of the central booster  cranking up the power.
""We could dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want  we could add two more side boosters  make it Falcon Super Heavy  get upwards of 9 million pounds of thrust ""  Musk  said on the press call.
For now   it  appears unnecessary for SpaceX to make a rocket that powerful.  It  would need extra testing and provide more power than what planned future Falcon Heavy missions would require.",281,general,None,[TGT] - general

1069,"With only three months to go before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle  both the fashion and bridal worlds are abuzz with talk of who the bride will pick to design her dress and what kind of look she would go for.

Front-runners for  Markle 's choice include British-Canadian Erdem Moralioglu  known for his elegant  feminine styles; Ralph & Russo  the couture designers  Markle  chose for  her  engagement dress; heritage fashion powerhouse Burberry; as well as McQueen and Giles Deacon  who designed the wedding gown for Kate's sister Pippa Middleton.

''But probably we would have to place our bets on a British designer.""
Some are hoping  Markle  will pick something less traditional because  she  has more leeway. After all  Harry is only fifth in line to the throne â and will be sixth after Kate  the Duchess of Cambridge  gives birth to her third child in April.

Sporting a weathered ox-hide jacket and steel-toed work boots  and driving a beat-up Mazda to political rallies    [TGT]   maintained a working-class persona that veered sharply from that of Mugabe  a former Marxist revolutionary who favored well-tailored suits and a cavalcade fit for a king.
As the founding leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)  the countryâs leading opposition party   Mr. Tsvangirai  oversaw what at times seemed to be a suicidal effort to oust Mugabe  an autocrat who ruled the country for 37 years.
Soldiers whipped   [TGT] with belts  prosecutors charged   [TGT]   with treason and plotting to assassinate the president ( he  was acquitted  but could have been sentenced to death)  and assassins tried to take   [TGT]   life at least three times  including a 1997 attempt when   [TGT]   was nearly thrown out the window of   [TGT]   10th-story office.",220,science,None,[TGT] - science

As  they  begin the Nationals begin  their  search for  their  next manager  the club has been granted permission to interview Chicago Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez and New York Mets hitting coach Kevin Long about their managerial opening  and both are slated to interview for the job  according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Martinez checks a few boxes. He played for nine organizations over 16 seasons in the majors as an outfielder and first baseman  which would give him credibility in a veteran  star-laden clubhouse. He doesnât have managerial experience at the highest level  but has served as  [TGT] âs bench coach since 2008 â first with the Tampa Bay Rays before joining him in Chicago in 2015. The Rays won the American League pennant in his first season and the Cubs advanced to the NL Championship Series in each of the past three years  winning the franchiseâs first World Series in 108 years last October. So he has enjoyed postseason success as the right-hand man for Maddon  who is widely regarded as one of baseballâs best managers.
âItâs baffling to me a bit why [Martinez isnât considered] more often â  Maddon  told the Chicago Tribune during the Nationals-Cubs NLDS earlier this month. â He âs been around a lot of winning teams here  and not only that   him  as a player  thatâs what drew me to  him  a bit with the Rays. I never had been with  him  as a teammate but watched  him  play.  He  was such a heady  aggressive  gritty kind of player and bilingual. All that matters.  He âs not afraid to have tough conversation a lot of times people in that position may shy away from.â
Long served as hitting coach for the New York Yankees for eight seasons  which included winning the 2009 World Series  before joining the Mets coaching staff in 2015.  He âs credited with helping Daniel Murphy overhaul  his  swing and approach that season. Murphy had one of the greatest postseasons in modern history  fueling the Mets to the World Series before signing with the Nationals that winter. He is entering the final year of his three-year contract with Washington and has spoken highly of Long.",381,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

1113,"Now   [TGT] is preparing to jump into this very fray. But   [TGT]   does so with an unusual mindset.  Meanwellâs company  is developing inclisiran  a first-in-class PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor with the potential to be at least as effective as Repatha and Praluent  maybe better. One major difference is that inclisiran only needs to be dosed once every six months  far less than the twice monthly dosing that the current agents employ. Thus  inclisiran has an obvious dosing/convenience advantages  as well as a cost-of-goods advantage over existing agents.
However  in a recent conversation   Meanwell  shared that  he  doesnât plan to compete solely on these benefits of inclisiran. Rather   he  plans to broaden access to inclisiran via a significantly lower price as compared to the established agents. Part of  his  move to this position was based on studying the changes in the top ten selling drugs of 2000 vs. those of 2015. The former group  which included drugs like Lipitor  Celebrex and Zoloft  generated sales of $34 billion (inflation adjusted). The 2015 list  which included Humira  Harvoni and Embrel  amassed $84 billion. These data are not all that shocking. But what surprised  him  was that the $34 billion spent in 2000 benefited a target population of 413 million patients  whereas the top ten selling drugs of 2015 only benefited 54 million. Basically  the top ten drugs of 2015 are targeting one-eighth of the 2000 population at 2.5X the cost.  He  believes that such a trend is unsustainable for healthcare in America.
So  what does  he  plan to do about it? Meanwell believes that inclisiran can be a very successful drug at a much lower price than Repatha and Praluent. Before dosing a single patient with inclisiran  The Medicines Company generated data to know exactly the type of profile the drug needed to have in order to be able to do this. Its phase 2 data from the ORION 1 study supports Meanwellâs view. Assuming this profile holds through the recently started phase 3 program  inclisiran would be positioned to be the PCSK9 inhibitor for the masses â a drug priced so that anyone with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and anyone who has already had a heart attack would have access to inclisiran.
Itâs unusual for a company to develop a first-in-class drug and then compete on price. In the past  companies have priced new drugs at a similar level that existing agents enjoyed. Mimicking such past practices  inclisiran on FDA approval would have been priced in the range that Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have negotiated with payers. After all  inclisiranâs ultimate clinical profile will likely be similar to their drugs  so why not enjoy a similar price? Instead   Meanwell  plans to succeed by charging a much lower price thereby gaining greater payer acceptance and access to a much larger patient base.

However  in a recent conversation   Meanwell  shared that  he  doesnât plan to compete solely on these benefits of inclisiran. Rather   he  plans to broaden access to inclisiran via a significantly lower price as compared to the established agents. Part of  his  move to this position was based on studying the changes in the top ten selling drugs of 2000 vs. those of 2015. The former group  which included drugs like Lipitor  Celebrex and Zoloft  generated sales of $34 billion (inflation adjusted). The 2015 list  which included Humira  Harvoni and Embrel  amassed $84 billion. These data are not all that shocking. But what surprised  him  was that the $34 billion spent in 2000 benefited a target population of 413 million patients  whereas the top ten selling drugs of 2015 only benefited 54 million. Basically  the top ten drugs of 2015 are targeting one-eighth of the 2000 population at 2.5X the cost.  He  believes that such a trend is unsustainable for healthcare in America.
So  what does  he  plan to do about it? Meanwell believes that inclisiran can be a very successful drug at a much lower price than Repatha and Praluent. Before dosing a single patient with inclisiran  The Medicines Company generated data to know exactly the type of profile the drug needed to have in order to be able to do this. Its phase 2 data from the ORION 1 study supports Meanwellâs view. Assuming this profile holds through the recently started phase 3 program  inclisiran would be positioned to be the PCSK9 inhibitor for the masses â a drug priced so that anyone with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and anyone who has already had a heart attack would have access to inclisiran.
Itâs unusual for a company to develop a first-in-class drug and then compete on price. In the past  companies have priced new drugs at a similar level that existing agents enjoyed. Mimicking such past practices  inclisiran on FDA approval would have been priced in the range that Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have negotiated with payers. After all  inclisiranâs ultimate clinical profile will likely be similar to their drugs  so why not enjoy a similar price? Instead   Meanwell  plans to succeed by charging a much lower price thereby gaining greater payer acceptance and access to a much larger patient base. While not unprecedented  this is not a common practice.",476,science,Positive,[TGT] - science
1114,"Meanwell  wasnât willing to give a specific price being contemplated for inclisiran.  He âll have a better idea on that once the phase 3 data for inclisiran begin to roll out. But  he  was quite confident that it would be significantly less than that for currently marketed PCSK9 inhibitors  certainly low enough to get payers on board. In fact  The Medicines Company has already opened up a dialogue with payers to factor their views into these key decisions.
It will be a while before The Medicines Company gets to this crossroad as phase 3 has just begun. But this will be an important program to watch. If  Meanwell  is successful and inclisiran turns out to be a successful product   it  could change the drug pricing philosophy for the biopharmaceutical industry.",130,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

1126,"A federal judge is allowing a wrongful arrest lawsuit to proceed against Fox Lake and other area law enforcement agencies that investigated the death of police Lt.   [TGT] whose staged suicide was portrayed for two months as the line-of-duty murder of a hero.
The three men who are suing claim they were unfairly targeted and detained as suspects when   [TGT] was found shot to death in a remote area of the village after telling a radio dispatcher that he was pursuing three men on foot.
Authorities ultimately determined   [TGT] took  [TGT]  life amid fears that  [TGT]  embezzlement of funds from the local youth police Explorer program was about to be exposed.
In  [TGT]  10-page ruling   [TGT]  said the plaintiffs âset out facts sufficient to allegeâ that the massive manhunt âfor   [TGT]  nonexistent killersâ resulted in part from the villageâs âfailure to supervise or disciplineâ the lieutenant before his death.
Two of the men whoâve sued â Raymond Willoughby and Damien Ward â say they were arrested the day of  Gliniewicz âs death  on Sept. 1  2015. Willoughby says in the suit that he was handcuffed  brought to a neighboring police station and held for several hours. Ward also says he was handcuffed and held for two hours and that officers tried to enter his home without a warrant.
In the same ruling this week  the judge dismissed Round Lake Park Police Chief George Filenko as a defendant in the lawsuit. Filenko was commander of the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force  which led the investigation into  Gliniewicz âs death. But Gregory E. Kulis  the attorney for the men who filed suit  said he would revise his complaints against Filenko in hopes of returning him as a defendant.
Willoughby  Ward and Cooper say they were targeted unfairly after  Gliniewicz  radioed in a vague description of three men he said he was pursuing  two white and one black.
A financial review of his management of a youth police training program was bearing down on him. The review later showed that  Gliniewicz  had taken thousands of dollars from the Explorers youth group and used the money for personal travel  loans  cash and adult websites.
But before those allegations became public   Joseph Gliniewicz   a heavily tattooed Army veteran known to many as âG.I. Joe â was portrayed as a selfless mentor and public servant. Thousands attended  Gliniewicz âs funeral.
Suspicions against him grew strong in October 2015  when authorities found what they called âselectively deletedâ text messages indicating he was trying to cover up his financial malfeasance and considered harming the village administrator who was leading the probe of the youth groupâs budget.

1178,"One of the biggest wild cards in the 2018 battle for the U.S. Senate may not be so wild after all.   [TGT] federal corruption trial ended in a hung jury last week. That leaves   [TGT]   free to run for reelection in 2018.  Menendez  could be retried  but many legal experts believe that a conviction is unlikely. Without that conviction  and absent major action following a Senate ethics investigation   Menendez  is a clear favorite in 2018.
The case against an easy  Menendez  victory in the general election comes down to  his  current popularity â or lack thereof. An October Quinnipiac University survey put his approval rating at just 31 percent among New Jersey voters; 49 percent disapproved. Whether or not  Menendez  remains this unpopular following the lack of a conviction remains unclear. But any senator who has an approval rating of 31 percent should be in some danger of losing.
Yet  the Republicans who have emerged to challenge  Menendez  arenât likely to strike much fear in  his  campaign. None has more than about $4 000 on-hand  according to the Federal Election Commission.  Menendez  has nearly $4 million. Ousting an incumbent senator â even an unpopular one â with no money is â¦ difficult. Thatâs especially true for a Republican in blue New Jersey given how expensive New York and Philadelphia media markets are.
That  Menendez  is an incumbent also helps. The advantage of incumbency can vary by election  and  on average  itâs gotten smaller in recent years. But incumbents still usually do better than youâd expect given a stateâs fundamentals. In 2012  for example   Menendez  won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points.  He  did so when the national political environment was much less friendly to Democrats than it looks to be in 2018 â Democrats won the national House vote by 1 percentage point in 2012. That is   Menendez  did about 6 points better than youâd expect a Democrat to do in New Jersey in 2012.",325,politics,Positive,[TGT] - politics

1179,"Menendez  probably wonât win by 30 points. The scandal will almost certainly hurt  him . Itâs just unlikely to hurt  him  by enough to give a Republican that good of a chance. A paper from Nicholas Chad Long estimated that Senate incumbents from 1974 to 2008 involved in scandals lost an average of 12.6 percentage points off their reelection margin. In such a scenario   Menendez  would still be forecasted to win by about 20 percentage points. Obviously  thereâs a margin of error surrounding this estimate  but it would take a pretty big error for  Menendez  to lose given these fundamentals.
So  Menendez   scandal notwithstanding  would be a general election favorite. There has  however  also been talk that a fellow Democrat might defeat him in the primary  before he ever gets to the general. Again  Iâm skeptical.
The most well-known potential challenger  former U.S. Sen. Bob Torricelli  announced on Thursday that he would not run. No Democratic challenger has raised any money with the FEC.  Menendez  has also locked down the endorsements of pretty much every major Democratic political player in the state  including the incoming Democratic governor  Phil Murphy.
Democrats looking to take on  Menendez  may also be warned off by the polling.  Menendez  is still moderately popular with Democratic voters. The aforementioned Quinnipiac survey had  his  approval rating with Democrats at 45 percent; 27 percent disapproved. And again keep in mind  this polling was conducted before the jury failed to convict  Menendez . It wouldnât be surprising if  [TGT]  [TGT]   approval rating rose now  especially if the 28 percent of Democrats who were undecided before the hung jury move into the approval column post-trial.
Of course  nothing in politics is certain.

[The mounting attacks on  Mueller  are misguided and dangerous]
Well  it sure seems to be. Itâs not surprising that Trump and those on his payroll want to protect him at all costs. But we learned last week that Republicans are deepening their complicity in derailing Muellerâs investigation and burying the facts. The more  Mueller  imperils Trump  the more McCarthyite the GOP becomes.
The apotheosis of Republican congressional collusion with Trumpâs efforts to hang on at all costs came at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. One Republican after another attacked  Mueller  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as if the latter should be placed on a new compendium of subversive organizations.
The rationale for this GOP assault is that Peter Strzok  an FBI agent involved in the investigation  exchanged texts critical of Trump and favorable to Clinton with an FBI lawyer. Somehow   Mueller  got no props for removing Strzok from the investigation this summer.
Because we are inured to extreme partisanship and to the political rightâs habit of rejecting inconvenient facts  we risk overlooking the profound political crisis that a Trumpified Republican Party could create. And the conflagration may come sooner rather than later  as  Mueller  zeroes in on Trump and his inner circle.

The more  Mueller  imperils Trump  the more McCarthyite the GOP becomes.
The apotheosis of Republican congressional collusion with Trumpâs efforts to hang on at all costs came at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. One Republican after another attacked  Mueller  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as if the latter should be placed on a new compendium of subversive organizations.
The rationale for this GOP assault is that Peter Strzok  an FBI agent involved in the investigation  exchanged texts critical of Trump and favorable to Clinton with an FBI lawyer. Somehow   Mueller  got no props for removing Strzok from the investigation this summer.
Because we are inured to extreme partisanship and to the political rightâs habit of rejecting inconvenient facts  we risk overlooking the profound political crisis that a Trumpified Republican Party could create. And the conflagration may come sooner rather than later  as  Mueller  zeroes in on Trump and his inner circle.

1308,"Eight women have told The Washington Post that longtime television host  Charlie Rose  made unwanted sexual advances toward them  including lewd phone calls  walking around naked in their presence  or groping their breasts  buttocks or genital areas.
The women were employees or aspired to work for  Rose  at the âCharlie Roseâ show from the late 1990s to as recently as 2011. They ranged in age from 21 to 37 at the time of the alleged encounters. Rose  75  whose show airs on PBS and Bloomberg TV  also co-hosts âCBS This Morningâ and is a contributing correspondent for â60 Minutes.â
There are striking commonalities in the accounts of the women  each of whom described their interactions with  Rose  in multiple interviews with The Post. For all of the women  reporters interviewed friends  colleagues or family members who said the women had confided in them about aspects of the incidents. Three of the eight spoke on the record.
âIn my 45 years in journalism  I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked â  Rose  said in a statement provided to The Post. âNevertheless  in the past few days  claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues.
Within hours of the publication of this article  PBS and Bloomberg LP immediately suspended distribution of the âCharlie Roseâ show. CBS announced that it was suspending  Rose  as it looked into the matter.
Most of the women said  Rose  alternated between fury and flattery in his interactions with them. Five described  Rose  putting his hand on their legs  sometimes their upper thigh  in what they perceived as a test to gauge their reactions. Two said that while they were working for  Rose  at his residences or were traveling with him on business  he emerged from the shower and walked naked in front of them. One said he groped her buttocks at a staff party.
Reah Bravo was an intern and then associate producer for Roseâs PBS show beginning in 2007. In interviews  she described unwanted sexual advances while working for  Rose  at his private waterfront estate in Bellport  N.Y.  and while traveling with him in cars  in a hotel suite and on a private plane.

They ranged in age from 21 to 37 at the time of the alleged encounters. Rose  75  whose show airs on PBS and Bloomberg TV  also co-hosts âCBS This Morningâ and is a contributing correspondent for â60 Minutes.â
There are striking commonalities in the accounts of the women  each of whom described their interactions with  Rose  in multiple interviews with The Post. For all of the women  reporters interviewed friends  colleagues or family members who said the women had confided in them about aspects of the incidents. Three of the eight spoke on the record.
âIn my 45 years in journalism  I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked â  Rose  said in a statement provided to The Post. âNevertheless  in the past few days  claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues.
Within hours of the publication of this article  PBS and Bloomberg LP immediately suspended distribution of the âCharlie Roseâ show. CBS announced that it was suspending  Rose  as it looked into the matter.
Most of the women said  Rose  alternated between fury and flattery in his interactions with them. Five described  Rose  putting his hand on their legs  sometimes their upper thigh  in what they perceived as a test to gauge their reactions. Two said that while they were working for  Rose  at his residences or were traveling with him on business  he emerged from the shower and walked naked in front of them. One said he groped her buttocks at a staff party.
Reah Bravo was an intern and then associate producer for Roseâs PBS show beginning in 2007. In interviews  she described unwanted sexual advances while working for  Rose  at his private waterfront estate in Bellport  N.Y.  and while traveling with him in cars  in a hotel suite and on a private plane.

1373,10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears lost to the New Orleans Saints 20-12 on Sunday afternoon at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. 1. I donât know that there is a player out there in the NFL that has been able to maintain such a positive attitude in the face of such a series of major injuries as Bears tight end   [TGT]  . Maybe such a player exists but I havenât met him. News Monday morning came from ESPNâs Chris Mortensen that  Miller  underwent surgery Sunday night in New Orleans due to extensive damage to  his  left leg  including reported artery damage. A lot of times 10 Thoughts is led by a key play that decides the game  a big-time performance or perhaps an emerging theme. Itâs impossible to overlook the latest setback for  Miller  though  who suffered what the Bears announced was a dislocated left knee on a corner route in the end zone. Now  we know itâs much more serious than that. Yes  it looked like  Miller  controlled the ball for a touchdown and that is what officials originally ruled. The bigger issue than the play  which was reversed after replay review (more on that a little later) is what looks like the loss of  Miller  for the remainder of the season.  He âs such a well-liked teammate and has always been appreciated by the coaches that have rolled through since former general manager Phil Emery brought  Miller  in back in 2014. âItâs awful to see any of your teammates go down with an injury that necessitates being carted off â said right guard Kyle Long. The two commiserated in rehabilitation just this past season. Long had surgery to repair his badly injured right ankle and  Miller  had surgery to repair  his  broken right foot on the same day at the same hospital last year. They had rooms across from each other. â He âs been here for a long time with me â Long said. â He âs a tough son of a (gun) and  he  is one of the most resilient guys I have ever been around and one of the best human beings I have played with. So my prayers are out to  him .â  The 33-year-old Miller  has 20 receptions for 236 yards and two touchdowns  the only player on the roster with more than one TD grab. But beyond the numbers what has always struck me is what an upbeat and wildly positive guy  Miller  has been.  He âs stuck to it and created a nice career for  himself  while overcoming obstacles that would have turned away a lot of other players. Since 2000  the only Bears player I can think of that was similarly snakebitten when it came to injuries was talented guard Rex Tucker.  He  appeared in 35 games from 1999 through 2004. This was  Miller âs 33rd game for the Bears in four years.

The epic saga of the Binewskis  a family of circus freaks  and the tragic fate of their traveling sideshow  Geek Love was a finalist for the National Book Award and has since inspired cultish devotion (just Google âGeek Love tattoosâ). It has sold more than 475 000 copies in the United States alone. In championing weirdness over âthe horror of normalcy â the novel became scripture to readers on the margins of the mainstream  attracting such high-profile admirers as Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.   [TGT] grafted vaudeville vernacular onto a cool classicism  a prose style at once effortless and extravagant. And in Geek Loveâs fun-house mirror  conventional hierarchies of beauty and worth are upendedâan alluring inversion for legions of readers to whom the Binewskis are folk heroes.

In that role and given   [TGT]   experience    [TGT] is among the most influential people in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.
In  [TGT] has described the poaching problem that the Computer Science department has  given its stable of extraordinary talent in fields such as artificial intelligence  machine learning  robotics  and others that are high in demand. Of course   he  recognizes  himself  in those professors and students who would choose to follow their passions into lucrative positions in the private sector. The department allows professors to leave and come back in many cases  and is hiring at higher rates in anticipation of this trend continuing.

They were two of the four people who  in 1956  took part in the Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference  where they discussed what might be possible with computers in the future. These two gentlemen were in the business school at Carnegie Tech  which later became Carnegie Mellon University. There was  of course  not a computer science school in the 1960s. Newell and Simon used their passion and extreme intellect to speculate and bring together a team of people who looked at  not what computers would do in the next five to 10 years  but what it would mean to live in a world where there are thinking machines. They inspired so many other thinkers through that period that it snowballed over the decades. Today  we have 250 faculty members in the School of Computer Science. They work on everything from the lowest level details of how photons move and how you count them up  to the highest level details of what it means to have an emotional relationship with a talking machine. It was Newell's and Simon's initial interest that sparked this and shaped our computer science department.,201,politics,None,[TGT] - politics

1393,"[TGT] has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison for child pornography. (Paul Sancya/Associated Press)
In a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday at a Michigan county court  the stateâs attorney generalâs office asked that former USA Gymnastics and  Michigan State doctor  [TGT] be sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison. A sentencing hearing is set to take place next week for  Nassar   who pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of sexually assaulting young girls  and it is expected to last several days  with dozens of girls and women to testify about the abuse he inflicted on them under the guise of medical treatment.
According to the Lansing State Journal  prosecutors chose the high end of their request  125 years  to reflect the number of people who reported assaults by  Nassar  to Michigan State Police. The total number of complaints against him  including from Olympic gold medalists Gabby Douglas  Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney  is more than 150.
In December   Nassar  was sentenced to 60 years in prison on federal charges related to child pornography  which  he  is appealing. The 54-year-old lost  his  physicianâs license in April  approximately three weeks after USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny resigned amid widespread criticism of the organizationâs handling of sexual abuse complaints lodged by athletes and others against  Nassar  and several coaches.
âFor decades  Nassar  preyed upon unknowing victims at every turn and at every opportunity: in the basement of his home  at this medical clinic  at his volunteer gym  at United States Gymnastics training facilities  and at hotels across the world â Michigan assistant attorney general Angela Povilaitis wrote in the sentencing memorandum (via the State Journal).
Michigan State announced in December that it would set up a $10 million fund to assist women and girls who have said  Nassar  abused them. The school and USA Gymnastics are the subjects of scores of lawsuits from women and girls claiming not enough was done to protect them from Nassarâs predations.

In a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday at a Michigan county court  the stateâs attorney generalâs office asked that former USA Gymnastics and  Michigan State doctor  [TGT] be sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison. A sentencing hearing is set to take place next week for  Nassar   who pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of sexually assaulting young girls  and it is expected to last several days  with dozens of girls and women to testify about the abuse he inflicted on them under the guise of medical treatment.
According to the Lansing State Journal  prosecutors chose the high end of their request  125 years  to reflect the number of people who reported assaults by  Nassar  to Michigan State Police. The total number of complaints against him  including from Olympic gold medalists Gabby Douglas  Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney  is more than 150.
In December   Nassar  was sentenced to 60 years in prison on federal charges related to child pornography  which  he  is appealing. The 54-year-old lost  his  physicianâs license in April  approximately three weeks after USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny resigned amid widespread criticism of the organizationâs handling of sexual abuse complaints lodged by athletes and others against  Nassar  and several coaches.
âFor decades  Nassar  preyed upon unknowing victims at every turn and at every opportunity: in the basement of his home  at this medical clinic  at his volunteer gym  at United States Gymnastics training facilities  and at hotels across the world â Michigan assistant attorney general Angela Povilaitis wrote in the sentencing memorandum (via the State Journal).
Michigan State announced in December that it would set up a $10 million fund to assist women and girls who have said  Nassar  abused them. The school and USA Gymnastics are the subjects of scores of lawsuits from women and girls claiming not enough was done to protect them from Nassarâs predations.
USA Gymnastics responded to those allegations in a statement Tuesday  saying that it ânever attempted to hide  Nassar âs misconduct.â The organization said it âkept the matter confidential because of the FBIâs directive not to interfere with the investigation. â¦ The information that Maggie and later a second athlete provided was important  but did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred.â

In 2015  the Republican governor issued an executive order and filed a legal case aiming to ban public-sector unions from collecting fees from government workers who opted out of a union. The move put the issue on a track to the high court  even though  Rauner  is no longer officially involved in the case.
Speaking to reporters  [TGT] said government employee union contributions to politicians were tantamount to âbribes.â
âEverything a government union does is political by its very nature â  Rauner  continued. âIt impacts taxpayers; it impacts government and politics. One hundred percent of what a government union does is political by nature  therefore forced payment of dues is political speech.â
The governor arrived in Washington on Sunday and marked what he called his first meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House Governorsâ Ball hosted by the president.  Rauner  has kept Trump at armâs length in the past and at times has declined to use the presidentâs name. He said his talks with the president at the White House were not extensive  calling them âmore a social opportunity.â

1433,"CHARLOTTE  Mich. (AP) â The final sentencing hearing began Wednesday for disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar  who was again confronted by victims as he faced another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts at an elite Michigan club run by an Olympic coach.
Judge Janice Cunningham has set aside several days for more than 60 women and girls who want to confront  Nassar  or have their statement read in court. The hearing could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county where a different judge allowed more than 150 women and girls to confront  Nassar  about  his  abuse.
That hearing ended with  Nassar  getting sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison  with the judge describing it as Nassarâs âdeath warrant.â
Annie Labrie said what  Nassar  did to her made her âskin crawl â but every adult around her assured her he was the only option  and she hid the abuse from her parents. She said it is imperative for society to understand Nassarâs pedophilia was not an isolated incident  and gymnastics and gyms like Twistars have a âspecific cultureâ that allows people like him to flourish.
The practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. But attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal  especially since  Nassar  pleaded guilty  agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of  his  deal with prosecutors.
âHer obvious delight was just off the wall â Raben said  referring to Aquilinaâs âdeath warrantâ remark and others. âI am not defending   [TGT] at all  but what I saw with   [TGT]   was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor. â¦ The process doesnât change because everybody hates the defendant. That is the absolute glory  or should be  of the American justice system.â
The case on Cunninghamâs docket Wednesday in Eaton County centers on Nassarâs assaults at Twistars  a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert.  Nassar  admits penetrating three girls with  his  hands when  he  was supposed to be treating them for injuries.

âIt all goes to this fundamental need to make sure weâre getting people the information they need â   [TGT] said. âWhat it ultimately should come down to is a clearer  crisper  more informative way of speaking to our customers.â
â  [TGT]   have noticed that when   [TGT]   conductors give   [TGT]   customers a little information about the various sites of interest across the city  it makes their commute brighter â the bulletin said.
Some conductors in a pilot program will also get smartphones enabling them to get information they can transmit to riders as needed    [TGT] said. The MTA also plans to hold training sessions for conductors on how to make announcements easier to understand by speaking clearly and slowly.",199,science,None,[TGT] - science

Itâs hard to miss them â theyâre everywhere  from the nameless X-wing pilots and First Order officers to the most important heroes of the day.
The Last Jedi isn't the first Star Wars film to give its female characters a chance to take the spotlight: The Force Awakens opened with a bang when it gave its lead role to  Rey   turned Leia into a general and included Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie)  a female commander on the dark side. The standalone prequel Rogue One starred Felicity Jones as the Han Solo-esque Jyn Erso.
The moment when  Rey  grabbed the lightsaber at the end of The Force Awakens was powerful and emotional  not unlike the No Man's Land sequence in Wonder Woman this year that brought female viewers to tears. And The Last Jedi is the natural step forward Hollywood should be taking with its representation  telling stories about its women that don't have to be the single defining narrative for the franchise. In doing so  the film finds room  alongside  Rey âs epic heroâs journey  for subplots about the bonds of sisterhood or female authority figures dealing with hot-headed male underlings. It just scratches the surface of the stories these films can tell.

The move means   [TGT] is leaving a race to take U.S. Sen. Bob Caseyâs seat.   [TGT] had been facing off against Rep. Lou Barletta for the Republican nomination and opportunity to challenge Casey.

Wagner promises in the video that the two will  âchange the way things have always been done in Harrisburg.  Jeff  will help me make Harrisburg work for you  the taxpayers â not special interests or insiders.â

Given the backlash  it's understandable that  Streep  attempted to turn the tables when the Times reporter asked  her  about #MeToo.

Her  statements on social media are infrequent and rote.  She  has yet to take a public stance more substantive than ""bullying is bad."" And the last time  she  addressed sexual misconduct  it was to defend  her  husband for his ""grab 'em by the pussy"" statements.
Ivanka is a different story.

The Penn scientists will report on their preliminary results  and investigators  who at the RAC's request have submitted thousands of pages of patient safety data to the committee  will discuss the side effects of adenovirus. Among them will be researchers from the Schering-Plough Corporation  which was running two experiments in advanced liver cancer patients that used methods similar to Penn's. Enrollment in those trials was suspended by the Food and Drug Administration after  Jesse 's death. The company  under pressure from the RAC  has since released information showing that some patients experienced serious side effects  including changes in liver function and blood-cell counts  mental confusion and nausea; two experienced minor strokes  although one had a history of them. Once all the data on adenovirus are analyzed at the Dec. 8 meeting  the RAC may recommend restrictions on its use  which will almost certainly slow down some aspects of gene-therapy research.
The meeting will be important for another reason: it will mark an unprecedented public airing of information about the safety of gene therapy -- precisely the kind of sharing the RAC has unsuccessfully sought in the past.

But since  his  death  there have been news reports that other patients died during the course of experiments -- from their diseases  as opposed to the therapy -- and that the scientists involved did not report those deaths to the RAC  as is required.

""The band went on break and I went and I sang a song "" says  Williams . ""And this hunter came up and  he  says  'I'll give you a hundred dollars if you sing another song.'""
Soon after   Williams  began writing songs like ""Happy Come Home "" a tune inspired by one of her neighbors who lost her dog.
""It touches me because of the lyric  'Happy come home.' Maybe it's not even a dog... maybe it's just happiness "" says  Williams .
From there   Williams  built a loyal following on simple songs that strike a deeper chord.
""To me  empathy is the main instrument of our very existence... The ordinary human condition in all of its comedy and tragedy â and she had all of that in a pronounced way "" says pianist and composer Van Dyke Parks  who has worked with such notable artists as The Beach Boys  U2 and Skrillex and arranged  Williams ' 1987 debut album.
That album caught the attention of the famed filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker  who had already made documentaries about Bob Dylan and the epochal Monterey Pop Festival. Pennebaker shot a short film about  Williams  and her music.
""I was like on the 23rd show "" says  Williams . ""All of a sudden my hands were numb and I couldn't play the guitar  so I'm just standing there sitting and singing a capella.
